In 2008 I went to Australia for a gap year with a Working Holiday Visa. Australia is huge, it is disconcerting when not used to. I discovered people living lives I didn't kown could still be lived. 

People in the Australian bush are pretty handy. They always find a way to build with what they have at hands. they find workarounds, since any shopping would take at least a day. They have their own airplanes, choppers, gas stations, landfill dumps, shool at home. 

They taught me how to ride a horse, muster cattle, weld yards, build concrete throughs, service bulldozers, take care of the animals, and much more.
