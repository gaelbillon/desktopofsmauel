Petra is a must-see archaeological site located at the south of Jordan (4-hour bus ride from Amman). As the poem says, Petra is ‘a rose-red city half as old as time.” The city has withstood thousand of years of history and remains to be absolutely breathtaking.

Carving tombs, passages, temples and theatre out of rose-red sandstone, Petra stayed a mystery for years until it was discovered by a Swiss explorer in 1812. Following a simple map, we chose one of the many trails to discover this nature/man-build wonder. We hiked to The High place of Sacrifice to get an overview of the valley and The Treasury (Al-Khazneh). It was an exhausting hike in the midday heat but it was totally worth it.
