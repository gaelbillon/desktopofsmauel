| Every you go in Colombia, there's always someone to ask you if you're having a good time in their country. From the tropical forests of Amazonas and the gigantic sprawl of Medellin to the deserted coast of el Choco, the country is incredibly diverse.

And it's dirt cheap ! You can have a plate full of waffles, bananas, chocolate and whipped cream for 2€. Flying across the country cost the price of a Uber to get back home on Friday night in western Europe. Food can conviniently be bought in the street. Such as Papas Rellenas which are a sortof ball of stuffed meat coated with mashed potato, it' pretty good.
