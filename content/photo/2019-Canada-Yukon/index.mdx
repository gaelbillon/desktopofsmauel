I've always dreamt of seeing the Yukon. Heart of the goldrush. Home to wolves, bears and cougars. Where a good part of the population has a seaplane in front of their house. Finally this dream came true. With the help of our HelpX host. Who welcomed us in a small but comfortable cabin in the woods. In exchange, we worked a few hours per day, building a goat fence. And learnt a lot along the way.
