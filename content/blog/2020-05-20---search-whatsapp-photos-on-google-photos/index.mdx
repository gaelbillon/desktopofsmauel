The image file names created by WhatsApp looking like this:

`824c5ad3-e505-4aac-928f-d34135ba968a.jpg`

Thus, images created by WhatsApp and uploaded to Google Photos can be found by typing this in the Google Photos search bar:

`*-*-*-*-*.jpg`

Or even simpler, click on this link:

[https://photos.google.com/search/\*-\*-\*-\*-\*.jpg](https://photos.google.com/search/*-*-*-*-*.jpg)

Please note that this search will also match files that were not created by WhatsApp. Such as files named week-end-at-the-beach.jpg for example. Or any file that has four dashes (-) in its name.
