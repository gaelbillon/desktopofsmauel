# Changelog

_Last Update: May 22, 2020_


## May 22, 2020

Work page is kind of dull right now with repeat content same as the Home page. I'm adding a screenshot carousel in replacing the "More Work" section. I have also updated the hero section for each case study, adding brand color and a transparent mock-up to let it be more attractive. In the end, I'm hoping to add some hover animation that could make the experience more interactive. 

- CHANGED Work Preview on Home Page, Limit to 2 Case Studies Only
- ADDED More Work Carousel using [React Carousel](https://github.com/brainhubeu/react-carousel)
- ADDED Prominent Hero Section for Individual Case Study Page
- UPDATED More detailed case study on the design process

## Apr 20, 2020

This is one of the biggest change since I have updated my website to Gatsby 2.0. The site has undergone massive refactor, after learning more on react, I have decided to retire some old components, switching Class Components to functional component and set up type checking using Proptype. I have also introduce a new typography system for better reading and vertical rhythm. Spacing between images and paragraph should be more loose than before. 

- ADDED New typography system
- CHANGED New primary font (Gibson from [Adobe Font](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/gibson))and secondary font (Libre Caslon Text from [Google Font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Libre+Caslon+Text))

## Mar 8,2020

My previous focus on the Photo section is to make Gatsby possible to serve as a photo portfolio. Now that it is completed (with some kind of manual work), I'm working on the aesthetic side. I have revamped the Photo Index Page and added a Photo grid section on Home page. The feature photo set seems still need some work on it as the style is incoherent. Loading speed of the home page is affected due to the photos added in the section, still working on a solution to it. 

- ADDED Photo grid section on Home Page
- CHANGED Photo page layout
